### Data Cleaning / Preparation

For the data preparation we perform the following tasks:

1. Import the libraries [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data cleaning and normalization

3. Removing duplicated values
4. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

After cleaning the data we start to ask key questions like:

- There are more movies or TV series?
- How many titles has been added since the start of the platform?
- How many titles are suitable for all ages?
- Which are the most added genres?
